## Motivation

- Large majorities want stronger environmental policy

- Massive youth and activist energy behind climate and environmental justice

- Policy fights don't end with legislation

- But agency policymaking is technocratic  
$\rightarrow$ hostile terrain for mass politics and activism  
$\rightarrow$ good for incumbent industries


???

Legal theorists debate the normative value of public participation in agency rulemaking.
The role of agency policymaking in a large democracy unsettled

Big push from this administration increase participation and democratize agency decision-making, but the aim is unclear

Moreover, Bureaucratic inertia frustrates any "all of government" initiatives

As a political scientist, I take a more empirical large-scale quantitative approach to figure out the potential and limits of activism targeting agencies

## The IRA fight isn't over 

"energy community".  
$\rightarrow$ already [300+ pages of guidance from Treasury](https://arcgis.netl.doe.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=a2ce47d4721a477a8701bd0e08495e1d) &  [maps from DOE](https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/)

"disadvantaged community"   
$\rightarrow$ "a community that the Secretary determines [is] disadvantaged"

"life cycle emissions" <!--$\rightarrow$ "additional"/"new" generation -->    
$\rightarrow$ $0 – ∞ billion for hydrogen

"facility"   
$\rightarrow$  0 – massive reductions in methane

The other day I mentioned work I'm doing with my mentor Dan Carpenter here on how the banks successfully pushed back on financial regulation after the financial crisis and Dodd-Frank Act by lobbying the regulatory agencies. 

There may be lessons here for how powerful incumbent interests responding to the IRA and especially if we get more regulatory legislation.

## Why? 

### $\rightarrow$ Big companies hire experts and lawyers

## When does public pressure affect agency rulemaking? 


Campaigns succeed when

1. They have broad **public support** & **showing support is easy**

???

Public support can be a resource. Presidents "go public" to get their agenda through Congress. Similarly, activists mobilize public attention when it shifts politics in their favor. 

--
1. They have **experts and lawyers**

--
2. They **shift the terms of debate** or **mobilize elected officials**

--
2. The agency has **capacity** (e.g. to address climate or environmental justice issues)


???

Pushing back against some of the skepticism about pressure.
It can help, but only in certain conditions
 involved, ideally both


The work that Carrie and Arie do at ELP is really important 

???
Framing values-based decisions as scientific may hurt more than it helps.

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies

## What do we do? 

- Make it someone's job inside the agency
- Consider group representation
- Make it easy to show support
- Hire lawyers
- Mobilize elected allies and issue frames
