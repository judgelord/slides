## Today's talk

1. What is at stake in energy policy
1. How the U.S. federal government makes policy
2. How money and lobbying affect policy
3. How advocacy campaigns and fights over issue framing affect policy 

   - e.g., what counts as "climate policy"  and what counts as "environmental justice?"

## Why understanding agency rulemaking matters

- Large majorities want stronger environmental policy and more sustainable energy

- Massive youth and activist energy behind climate and environmental justice

- Policy fights don't end with legislation

- But agency policymaking is technocratic  
$\rightarrow$ hostile terrain for mass politics and activism  
$\rightarrow$ good for incumbent industries


:::{.notes}

Legal theorists debate the normative value of public participation in agency rulemaking.
The role of agency policymaking in a large democracy unsettled

Big push from this administration increase participation and democratize agency decision-making, but the aim is unclear

Moreover, Bureaucratic inertia frustrates any "all of government" initiatives

As a political scientist, I take a more empirical large-scale quantitative approach to figure out the potential and limits of activism targeting agencies

The other day I mentioned work I'm doing with my mentor Dan Carpenter here on how the banks successfully pushed back on financial regulation after the financial crisis and Dodd-Frank Act by lobbying the regulatory agencies. 

There may be lessons here for how powerful incumbent interests responding to the IRA and, especially if we get more regulatory legislation.

## When does public pressure affect agency rulemaking? 

. . . 

Campaigns succeed when

1. They have broad **public support** & **showing support is easy**

:::{.notes}

Public support can be a resource. Presidents "go public" to get their agenda through Congress. Similarly, activists mobilize public attention when it shifts politics in their favor. 
:::

2. They **shift the terms of debate** or **mobilize elected officials**

  - Framing values-based decisions as scientific may hurt more than it helps.


3. They have **experts and lawyers**

4. The agency has **capacity** (e.g., to address climate or environmental justice issues)


:::{.notes}

Pushing back against some of the skepticism about pressure.
It can help, but only in certain conditions
 involved, ideally both

# Issue Framing





## 

> "He who determines what politics is about runs the country because the definition of conflicts allocates power." 
- E.E. Schattschneider

> "Environmental justice means something different in every context" - Monique Harden

## Executive Order 12898

Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations (1994)

>  "each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations" 

Executive Order 14096 (2023)

> "a whole-of-government commitment to environmental justice"

# An Empirical Study of Issue Framing 

## Preview: **Part 1**

 Large-scale analysis: *all* 15,000 draft and final rules from 52 agencies 2005-2024 & 50,000,000 comments on these rules

- Policy rarely addresses environmental justice
- Agencies add EJ language when pressured
  - $\uparrow$ pressure  $\rightsquigarrow$ 	$\uparrow$ change
- Puzzlingly little variation over time in baseline **rates** of addressing EJ *and* **responsiveness** to requests to do so
  - Yet, agencies were most responsive under Biden
- Responsiveness varies with institutional structure
 
## Preview: **Part 2** 

Medium-scale hand-coded sample of all 11,000 comments from organizations on 200 rules 

- adding EJ language may correlate with substantive policy change favoring public interest groups ("lobbying success")
- mostly Big Greens using generic EJ language
- radically different meanings of EJ across commenters and administrations

TOM ALLEN 

 Mercury standards that protected the average person in the US did not protect certain minority communities, in this case, many native communities who traditionally ate a lot more fish. 

I grew up in Wisconsin, in the center of the Great Lakes, and despite Friday fish fries, these regulations probably protected people in my family, BUT 

There is a large Hmong population that came over after the Vietnam war, and other commenters produced studies that certain Southeast Asian immigrant populations like the Hmong also ate a lot of freshwater fish and thus had higher rates of Mercury poisoning. Similarly,  Ojibwe people in the Great Lakes region had higher rates of mercury poisoning.

## The Environmental Justice Frame {background-image="https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_content/public/media-uploads/midwesttoxicdoughnut_25_002chicago_steel_mills-july_1965_vl_2400.jpg" background-size="cover"}


:::{.notes}
What is environmental justice, and why does the Biden administration require 40% of federal spending to be spent in environmental justice communities? 

The EJ movement began in local resistance to toxic waste in places like the  Alt-geld Gardens housing complex on Chicago's South Side, where activists like Hazel Johnson had been organizing tenants years before a young Barak Obama showed up in 1984. Surrounded by manufacturing and toxic waste dumps, this neighborhood got the nickname “the toxic doughnut.” 

Dorceta Taylor describes how black-led campaigns like Johnson's fused with the American Indian Movement, Chicano, and farmworker movements and drew on civil rights and union organizing to push the environmental justice frame onto the national policy agenda. 

Began appearing in federal policy documents in the 1980s

I aim to add more systematic quantitative data on the broad trends regarding the influence of the EJ movement on the federal policy agenda that Taylor and others have mapped.

:::

Why does this matter? 

- "Environmental" policy debates are rarely about *distributions* of costs and benefits

  - Reframing policy in distributive justice terms can shape normative, political, and economic analysis.


- For this research: "environmental justice" is a distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

---

### Scholars of bureaucracy focus on *technical* information



:::{.notes}
- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)


Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research, including my own research elsewhere, shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by “information,” scholars generally mean technical and legal information.
:::


. . . 

### How might *political* information matter?


- Advancing frames about who is affected/deserving?
- Novelty vs. legibility?
- Pressure: 
  - Coalition size? [(Dwidar 2021, Nelson & Yackee 2012)]()
  - Public attention?

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies

## How to interpret advocacy group adoption/cooption of EJ rhetoric?

- A contested and expanding frame: 

  - Any inequality across space, time, or identity group
  - Dominated by Big Green advocacy for non-targeted polices 
  - Increasingly used by those who are not historically marginalized (because all policy has disparate effects)
  
- Much more focused on substantive than procedural justice and rarely on enforcement


## Claims about unequal spatial-temporal distributions of environmental harms



Place-based EJ Groups: 

- Hotspots caused by averaging or trading among pollution sources  $\rightsquigarrow$ less pollution reduction (local EJ groups)
- Cumulative impacts caused by multiple co-located harms 
   - permitting decisions should account for nearby facilities that impact the same area
- Cumulative impacts caused harms that persist over time
   - permitting decisions for a facility should account for historic or naturally occurring harms
- EJScreen, MiEJScreen

Big Greens
- Unequal baselines  $\rightsquigarrow$  any overall reduction of pollution disproportionately benefits burdened communities, even when policy does not target them

<!--
##  Cumulative similar impacts 

National Environmental Policy Act 

> The Elimination of the Cumulative Impacts Analysis Raises Environmental Justice Concerns...Executive Order 12898 requires that each agency ensure that its actions foster environmental justice concerns. (CEQ-2019-0003-160397)

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Plywood and Composite Wood Products (EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0048)

> "The rule also does not involve special consideration of environmental justice-related issues as required by EO 12898.”
--> 

## Claims about unequal spatial distributions of environmental harms

Many groups don't even assert marginalization or historic oppression

. . . 

> Smoke from such wildfires substantially impacts public health. These serious health impacts are an environmental justice issue that many rural counties throughout Oregon face because of the federal government’s failure, or inability, to responsibly manage forests due, in large part, to unnecessary and/or unwarranted restrictions that all center around the spotted owl... [(Douglas County, 2008)](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-R1-ES-2020-0050-0539)

## Identity groups

In addition to geographic-based inequality, commenters raise inequalities linked to identities, including race, gender, age, and sector of employment.

>  People from
disadvantaged populations are more likely
to be employed in occupations with higher
levels of exposure (e.g., mining, construction,
manufacturing, agriculture, certain service
sector occupations) and to live in more highly
contaminated communities. The reality of
this unequal burden is not just a health issue,
but an issue of environmental justice. While all Americans now carry many
foreign chemicals in their bodies, women
often have higher levels of many toxic and
hormone-disrupting substances than do
men...Children of all ages are considerably more
vulnerable than adults... [(The President’s Cancer Panel)]()

## Intersections of space and identity 

- Language and culture overlap with specific geographies, especially with Native lands. Native commenters frequently assert harm to certain locations as harm to their culture. 

- Cumulative impacts at home and at work


## How should we interpret agency adoption of EJ rhetoric? 

- Mostly rebutting or dismissing complaints (most officials do not consider EJ analysis to be part of their job) with boilerplate EJ language asserting "no adverse effects on low-income or minority populations"

- But, some meaningful policy changes under all presidents

- But, mostly non-targeted policy advanced by historically white national advocacy groups (e.g., pollution limits, safety, public lands, marine sanctuaries)

- But, some targeted policy (catch limit exemptions, tribal consultation)

## Dismissing the need for EJ analysis

If the trend is in the right direction, the future is to be better than the past, and thus, comparative analysis of alternative futures with and without the policy is not needed. 

> EPA believes that the power sector is already on the path to achieving the CO2 reductions required by the CPP. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it would have any significant impact on EJ-affected communities. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355, 2019)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/08/2019-13507/repeal-of-the-clean-power-plan-emission-guidelines-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-existing)

The Biden EPA used a similar logic: 

> ...there is potential for some geographic areas and demographic groups to experience small increases in ozone concentrations relative to the baseline levels, which are projected to be substantially lower than today's levels. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-8244, 2024)](https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-8244)


## Offsetting benefits and harms

From the Trump administration's repeal of the Clean Power Plan EJ analysis: 

> While the EPA expects areas in the southeastern US to experience a modest increase in fine particle levels, areas including the Midwest will experience reduced levels of PM, yielding significant benefits in the form of fewer premature deaths and illnesses. On balance, the positive benefits of this action significantly outweigh the estimated disbenefits.

. . . 

$\longrightarrow$ allows local pollution hot spots

## Citing limits on unequal harms 

The Biden EPA addressed EJ complaints that emissions trading could lead to pollution hot spots but asserted that the policy included backstops intended to limit inequalities: 

> The EPA is cognizant of these concerns and believes that emission trading and averaging are not necessarily incompatible with environmental justice. The EPA is including limitations on the use of compliance flexibilities in state plans that should help address these EJ concerns.

Similarly, the Bush EPA cited other policies as backstops, arguing that deregulating hazardous air pollution would have no effect on nearby minority and low-income communities because polluters were still required to have a plan.

> "The only difference from current regulation is that the source is not required to follow the plan." [EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0094:	National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: General Provisions: Impacts]()



## Coopting the frame

Consumer prices as an environmental justice issue

> Low-income and minority communities located in proximity to EGUs may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result of the emissions reductions. However, the EPA did not address the potential distribution of compliance costs associated with the CPP...Low-income households typically spend a greater share of their household income on energy, and to the extent that this action reduces energy costs, those low-income households will experience lower energy bills. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355, 2017)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/16/2017-22349/repeal-of-carbon-pollution-emission-guidelines-for-existing-stationary-sources-electric-utility)

:::{.notes}
When the Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations on power plants (Electric Generating Units or EGUs), the Trump EPA advanced an argument that, despite harming air quality, the repeal served environmental justice because it preserved jobs and lowered utility bills in low-income communities near power plants. This section of the proposed rule on environmental justice then went on to link job loss to health risks and substance abuse.
:::

## Coopting the frame

"Job-killing" regulation as an environmental justice issue

> While employment effects are not experienced uniformly across the population and may be offset by new opportunities in different sectors, localized impacts could have adversely affected individuals and their communities... In addition, past research has suggested that involuntary job loss may increase risks to health, substance abuse, and even mortality. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355, 2017)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/16/2017-22349/repeal-of-carbon-pollution-emission-guidelines-for-existing-stationary-sources-electric-utility)

<!--
The Forest Service (FS) has by far the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions have acute distributional
effects. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have an institutional practice of addressing E.O.12898. 
Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration,  Federal Highway
Administration Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies make decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up.
Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also have a low but significant baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules.

### Rates of Change With and Without Comments Raising Environmental Justice
:::

::::

## Failing to respond

Example: the Obama Nuclear Regulatory Commission claimed to have received no input on environmental justice comments on Emergency Preparedness Regulations [NRC-2008-0122](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/NRC-2008-0122/unified-agenda).

> The NRC requested public comments on any environmental justice considerations that may be related to this rule and no comments were received. 

This was incorrect. A comment from Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. raised serious EJ concerns that went unaddressed in the rule:

> The rules and guidance are based on a fantasy world in which the terrain around nuclear power stations is perfectly flat, radiation plumes do not move up and down, the wind blows at the same speed in a constant direction throughout an accident, and most people follow the instructions they are given about the need to evacuate.

> **Need for Site-Specific Analysis of Transport-Dependent Populations:** The present guidance suggests that because 50% of residents would offer rides to those in need, approximately 50% of the transit-dependent population in the EPZ would rideshare. Criteria for Development of ETE Studies (April 23, 2009) at 13. This assumption fails to account for the likely separation of transit-dependent environmental justice populations from more affluent populations. Furthermore, it takes no account of attitudes towards race and the potential reluctance of whites to offer rides to African- Americans. Instead of presuming that 50% of the transit-dependent population will rideshare, the presumption should be that only a small percentage will rideshare unless the licensee can show that there are no geographical concentrations of transit-dependent populations and that there is no racial or sociological bias with regard to ridesharing.

> ...people would be foolish to follow the directions of first responders if they are based on totally unrealistic modeling. Indeed, it is doubtful whether people would follow instructions even if they were based on the best predictions possible. The experiences during Hurricane Katrina also underline that it is even more doubtful whether the response planned for environmental justice communities would actually materialize.

## Success Stories

Bush 

- Mercury Rules

Obama

- EPA comments to NMFS about effects on low-income fishing communities of Atlantic Highly Migratory Species: Atlantic Shark Management Measures; Final Amendment 5b (NOAA-NMFS-2013-0070) 
<!-- oil and gas drilling --> 

>The EPA submitted a comment recommending additional environmental justice information...and include in the EIS whether the proposed alternatives have any potential for disproportionate adverse impacts to minority and low-income populations. The EPA also recommended that the EIS include the approaches used to foster public participation by these populations and describe outreach conducted to all other communities that could be affected by the project because rural communities may be among the most vulnerable to health risks associated with the project.

> NMFS appreciates these recommendations from the EPA and has added additional information to the environmental justice discussion in Section 9.4 of the FEIS...Demographic data indicate that coastal counties with fishing communities are variable in terms of social indicators like income, employment, race, and ethnic composition.

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies


## Measuring influence

### DV 1: Getting policymakers' attention/engagement/response

1.1 Adding policy language (All 11,315 rules)   
1.2 Changing policy language (All 1,864 rules)

### DV 2: Getting substantive policy demands

Lobbying success for all commenters on a random sample of 150 rules (10,894 hand-coded comments)

2.1 Across 284 coalitions   
2.2 Within 3,932 organizations
 


## Modeling the probability of policy change


### (1) Variation across agencies:  
Pr(Policy Change | President) ~ Policy Demands  \+ Coalition Size  \+ Public Attention \+ Agency's Prior Rate of Addressing Environmental Justice
(\+ Interactions) 


### (2) Variation within agencies:  
Pr(Policy Change | President & Agency) ~ Policy Demands  \+  Coalition Size  \+  Public Attention
(\+ Interactions)


:::{.notes}
Both of my DVs---adding EJ language and changing existing EJ language--are dichotomous, so I'm going to use logit regression. 

The main models use president and agency fixed effects, so I'm focusing on variation within presidential administrations and within the agency, but I also assess differences across presidents and agencies by estimating the same models with indicators rather than fixed effects.

Because log odds coefficients are hard to interpret and because my models have interactions, I am going to skip the regression table and just show you predicted probabilities.

### (1.1a) Logit: $Y_i = \beta_{1:n} X_{i} + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ip}$

$Y_i$: the log odds of change in rule $i$ by agency $k$ under president $p$ <!--: $log[\frac{P(EJ\ in\ FR)}{1−P(EJ\ in\ FR)}]$-->


$X_{i}$: features of rule $i$
  - whether comments raise environmental justice
  
  - agency $k$'s share of prior draft rules mentioning environmental justice 

  - the number of organizations raising environmental justice (logged)

  - the total number of comments (logged) $\times$ whether comments raise environmental justice
  
$\delta_p$: president fixed effects   
$\epsilon_{ip}$: cluster-robust errors by president


:::{.notes}

Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (White correction), where it is assumed that the errors are independent, but the variance of their generative law may vary.

If vcov = "cluster", then the arbitrary correlation of the errors within clusters is accounted for. Same for vcov = "twoway": arbitrary correlation within each of the two clusters is accounted for.
fixest: sandwich

same as xtreg cluster in stata

### (1.1b) Logit:  $Y_i = \beta_{1:n} X_{i} + \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ipk}$

$Y_i$: the log odds of change in rule $i$ by agency $k$ under president $p$ <!--: $log[\frac{P(EJ\ in\ FR)}{1−P(EJ\ in\ FR)}]$-->

$X_{i}$: features of rule $i$
  - whether comments raise environmental justice
  - the number of organizations raising environmental justice (logged)
  - the total number of comments (logged) $\times$ whether comments raise environmental justice

$\gamma_k + \delta_p$: president & agency fixed effects   
$\epsilon_{ipk}$: cluster-robust errors  by president & agency



:::{.notes}

Because I expect decreasing marginal effects of additional comments, both overall (i.e., public attention) and those that mention EJ (coalition size), I use logged values. 

However, the conclusions are largely the same if I use a quadratic function instead. That analysis suggests that medium levels of attention are not so impactful. A small level of attention matters, and then it takes a very large amount of additional pressure to move things, which makes sense. For hypothesis testing, however, all of the effects are in the same direction, so I am going to present predicted probabilities from these models here.
